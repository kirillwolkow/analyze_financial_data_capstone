# Analyze Financial Data Capstone Project

Hello and welcome!

I'm a student of Codecademy. Currently I'm doing the 'Data Analysis' Career Path. For the course I finished this project, called "Analyze Financial Data Capstone" in which I made a portfolio analysis of some stocks:

- Apple
- Microsoft
- Tesla
- Amazon
- BYD
- NIO
- BioNTech
- Netflix
- Disney

You can find the final presentation in the folder "presentation".

You can open the project with a jupyter notebook.

I'm happy for every feedback I get! To be more precise, here are some questions:
1. How do you apply the efficient frontier line on the plot?
2. How do you add a colorbar for the sharpe ratio on the scatter plot (efficient frontier)?
3. How do you calculate the weights of a portfolio with a volatility of e.g. 0.35?
4. Is there a more elegant way to create subplots? (the code of the subplots "Adj Closing Prices" looks ugly)
5. How would you interpret the data?

Thank you for everything in advance!

PS: sorry for my english, I'm swiss.
